# Babble

A page that produces somewhat coherent babble from your writing. It generates a directed graph from your seed text, and automatically generates new text by taking random walks through the graph until it reaches the length of the original text.

Possible use case: curing writer's block.

See it at [mariaxia.github.io/babble](http://mariaxia.github.io/babble).
