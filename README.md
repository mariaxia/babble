# Babble

A page that produces somewhat coherent babble from your writing. It generates a directed graph from your seed text, shows you that graph, and generates new text by taking random walks through the graph until it reaches the length of the original text.

See it at [mariaxia.github.io/babble](http://mariaxia.github.io/babble).
